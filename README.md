
# Music Data Analysis: Spotify Trends (2000s vs 2010s)


## Overview
This Python project explores Spotify music trends from the 2000s and 2010s using audio attributes like energy, danceability, BPM, and popularity. It loads datasets, performs basic cleaning, generates summary statistics and visualizations, and includes an interactive Tkinter GUI for genre-based song recommendations via Plotly charts.

Key analyses:
- Average song attributes by decade (bar chart).
- Popularity distribution (histogram).
- Energy vs. Dance-ability correlation (scatter plot).
- Top 10 genres comparison (horizontal bar chart).
- Genre-specific top song recommendations (interactive bar chart).

Perfect for music enthusiasts or data scientists interested in audio feature trends!

## Screenshots
Here are example visualizations generated by the script.

*Horizontal bar chart stacking top genres for each decade (red for 2000s, purple for 2010s).*

### 5. Interactive Genre Recommendations (e.g., "Pop" Songs)

## Features
- **Data Loading & Cleaning**: Combines two CSV datasets, removes duplicates, and imputes missing values with means.
- **Summary Statistics**: Grouped averages for BPM, energy (`nrgy`), danceability (`dnce`), loudness (`dB`), valence (`val`), acousticness (`acous`), speechiness (`spch`), and popularity (`pop`).
- **Visualizations** (using Matplotlib):
  - Bar chart of average attributes (saved as `average_song_attributes_by_decades.png`).
  - Histogram of popularity distributions by decade.
  - Scatter plot of energy vs. danceability, colored by decade.
  - Horizontal bar chart comparing top 10 genres.
- **Interactive GUI** (using Tkinter + Plotly):
  - Dropdown to select a genre.
  - Displays top 10 songs by popularity in an interactive bar chart (with hover for BPM, energy, danceability).
- **Output**: Static plots display in popups; one plot auto-saves as PNG.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ (tested on 3.12).
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `plotly`, `tkinter` (built-in).
- Dataset files: `2000.csv` and `2010.csv` (place in project root or update paths).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/music-data-analysis.git
   cd music-data-analysis
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install pandas matplotlib plotly
   ```
   - `tkinter` is included in standard Python (no install needed).

3. Add your data:
   - Download Spotify datasets (e.g., from [Kaggle: Spotify 2000s & 2010s](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ektro/spotify-2000s-2010s)).
   - Place `2000.csv` and `2010.csv` in the project root.

## Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```
   python Music_data_analysis.py
   ```
   - Console output: Dataset info, preview, summary stats, and available genres.
   - Plots: All visualizations open in Matplotlib windows (first one saves as PNG).
   - GUI: A Tkinter window launches for genre selection.

2. In the GUI:
   - Choose a genre from the dropdown (e.g., "pop", "rock").
   - Click **Show Recommendations** to generate and open a Plotly bar chart in your browser.
   - Hover over bars for song details like BPM and energy.

Example console output:
